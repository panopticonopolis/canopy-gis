# GEE_DataDownloader
A tool to manage downloading and preprocessing of data from Google Earth Engine.

Note: Due to Google scrapping FusionTables this tool no longer works and will require some minor modifications to get up and running again. Fee free to submit a PR.

The tool handles:
- Querying GEE according to the requirements in the config file
- Preprocessing/filtering the data as needed (Cloud masking, Cloud free mosaic etc)
- Exporting the data to GCS bucket for mass download
- Handling all export tasks and retrying on failure

It realies on our cloud masking and mosaicing methods which are contained in the GEE_Utils library https://github.com/SiPEO/GEE_Utils

This code is free to use for academic and non-commercial purposes (in order to stay in line with the GEE terms of use). If you make use of our code please cite the following works respectively
